        <h2>General information /heading 2/</h2>
        <p>Saint Petersburg (Russian: Санкт-Петербург, tr. Sankt-Peterburg, IPA: [sankt pʲɪtʲɪrˈburk] ( listen)) 
           is the second largest city in Russia, politically incorporated as a federal subject (a federal city). 
           It is located on the Neva River at the head of the Gulf of Finland on the Baltic Sea.</p>
        <p>In 1914 the name of the city was changed from Saint Petersburg to Petrograd (Russian: Петроград, IPA: [pʲɪtrɐˈgrat]), 
           in 1924 to Leningrad (Russian: Ленинград, IPA: [lʲɪnʲɪnˈgrat]), and in 1991, back to Saint Petersburg.</p>

        <p>In Russian literature, informal documents, and discourse, the word "Saint" (Russian: Санкт) is usually omitted,
           leaving "Petersburg" (Russian: Петербург). In casual conversation Russians may drop the "burg" (Russian: бург) 
           as well, referring to it as "Piter" (Russian: Питер).</p>

        <h3>History /heading 3/</h3>
        <h4>Before 1900 /heading 4/</h4>
        <p>Swedish colonists built Nyenskans, a fortress, at the mouth of the Neva River in 1611, in a land then
            called Ingermanland, that was inhabited by Finnic tribe of Ingrians.[15] A small town called "Nyen" 
            grew up around it.</p>
        <p>Peter the Great was interested in seafaring and maritime affairs, and he intended to have Russia gain a 
           seaport, so it could trade with maritime nations.[16] He needed a better seaport than Arkhangelsk, which
           was on the White Sea to the north and closed to shipping for months during the winter.</p>
        <h4>1900 to present /heading4/</h4>
        <p>The Revolution of 1905 began in Saint Petersburg and spread rapidly into the provinces. During World War I,
           the Imperial government renamed the city Petrograd, meaning "Peter's City", to remove the German words 
           Sankt and Burg.
           In March 1917, during the February Revolution Nicholas II abdicated both for himself and on behalf of his 
           son, ending the Russian monarchy and over three hundred years of Romanov dynastic rule.</p>
